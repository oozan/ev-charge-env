<h3 align="center">Green Agent Benchmark for EV Charging Optimization</h3>

---

## 🌟 Overview

EVChargeEnv is a lightweight, stochastic reinforcement-learning environment designed for the  
AgentX + AgentBeats Competition (Berkeley RDI 2025).

It simulates:

- Electric vehicle battery charging
- Dynamic electricity pricing
- Fluctuating grid load
- Continuous control actions
- Multi-objective tradeoffs (cost vs. speed vs. grid stability)

---

## 🎯 Task Goal

The purple agent must:

- Charge the EV battery to full (1.0)
- Minimize electricity cost
- Avoid high grid load
- Adapt to changing conditions

---

## 🧠 State Space (Observation)

The agent receives:

charge_level (0-1), price (0-1), grid_load (0-1), time_step_norm (0-1)

---

## 🎛️ Action Space

Continuous charge rate 0.0 → 1.0.

---

## 🧮 Reward Function

Reward combines:

- progress_reward

* cost_penalty
* overload_penalty
* time_penalty

---

## 🔥 Scenarios

easy / medium / hard difficulty with different volatility and load patterns.

---

## 🔁 Episode Termination

Ends if full charge or max steps reached.

---

## 📊 Example Agent Behaviors

Greedy agent = fast but expensive  
Price-aware agent = slower but cheaper  
Random agent = unstable

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Output

Running:

python run_evaluation.py

Generates JSON like:

{
"avg_reward": ...,
"avg_steps": ...,
"episodes": 5
}
